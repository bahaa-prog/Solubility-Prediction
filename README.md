# Solubility-Prediction
# Molecular Solubility Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Problem
Determining how well chemical compounds dissolve in water (aqueous solubility) is critical for pharmaceutical development, chemical manufacturing, and environmental science. Traditional laboratory methods for measuring solubility are time-consuming, expensive, and require physical synthesis of compounds, creating significant bottlenecks in drug discovery and chemical research processes.

## Solution
This project implements a machine learning regression model to predict the aqueous solubility (logS) of chemical compounds using molecular descriptors from the Delaney Solubility dataset. The model learns complex patterns between molecular structure and solubility behavior, enabling rapid predictions without experimental testing.

## Dataset Features
- **MolLogP**: Molecular lipophilicity (octanol-water partition coefficient)
- **MolWt**: Molecular weight of the compound
- **NumRotatableBonds**: Number of rotatable bonds in the molecule
- **AromaticProportion**: Proportion of aromatic atoms in the structure
- **logS**: Logarithm of aqueous solubility (target variable)

## Key Benefits
**Speed**: Instant predictions versus hours or days of laboratory work
**Cost-Effective**: Eliminates expensive reagents and equipment requirements
**Scalability**: Evaluates thousands of compounds simultaneously
**Early Screening**: Enables rapid filtering of promising compounds before synthesis

## Applications
- **Drug Discovery**: Predicting bioavailability and absorption of pharmaceutical compounds
- **Chemical Manufacturing**: Optimizing solvent selection and process conditions
- **Environmental Assessment**: Evaluating chemical fate and transport in aquatic systems
- **Material Science**: Designing materials with specific solubility properties

## Technical Approach
The model uses supervised learning to establish relationships between molecular descriptors and solubility values. This approach transforms expensive, time-intensive laboratory measurements into computational predictions, accelerating research timelines and reducing development costs across multiple industries.

## Impact
By providing accurate solubility predictions, this tool supports faster drug development, more efficient chemical processes, and better environmental risk assessment, ultimately contributing to improved healthcare outcomes and sustainable chemical practices.
