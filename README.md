# Solubility-Prediction
Molecular Solubility Prediction Predicts chemical compound water solubility using ML on molecular descriptors (weight, lipophilicity, bonds, aromaticity). Replaces expensive lab testing with instant predictions for drug discovery and chemical research. Trained on Delaney dataset.
